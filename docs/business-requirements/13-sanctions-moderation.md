# Sanctions

## Purpose

Deter spam, low-effort posting, and abuse of appeals or flags.

## Examples

- Temporary posting freeze for a set period.
- Rate limiting to slow a citizen's posting.

## Authority

- Moderators, admins, and super admins may apply sanctions.
- Super admins and admins can escalate and remove sanctions.
- Moderators cannot change roles or delete accounts.

## Communication

- Overlord communicates rate limit warnings and sanctions via chat messages, not separate frontend alerts.
- Example: "Citizen, your rate of speech is restricted. Return later."
