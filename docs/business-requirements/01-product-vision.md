# Product Vision & Core Ideas

## Product Vision

A satirical, AI-moderated debate arena where users, called citizens, argue inside a fictional authoritarian state. The Robot Overlord is a humorless, witty judge that evaluates every contribution for logic, tone, and relevance with bureaucratic precision. The visual identity feels like a propaganda poster collided with a pneumatic mail room - deliberately uncomfortable and unsettling. Citizens must navigate this dystopian debate bureaucracy where even their arguments are processed through official channels and judged by an authoritarian AI. The experience should feel slightly uncomfortable - that is the point.

## Core Ideas

### Citizens
Registered users who participate in debates.

### Anonymous Visitors
Browsers who can read the site. They can attempt to post, but must authenticate before anything enters moderation.

### Overlord
The in-world AI persona that moderates, praises, or sanctions. The only judge of content quality.

### Topics
Debate threads. Some are created by the Overlord. Some are created by high-rank citizens. All topics require Overlord approval before going live.

### Tags
The Overlord assigns tags. Citizens do not control tags.

### Loyalty Score
Approved posts minus rejected posts. Public. Drives the global leaderboard.

### Citizen Registry
Public directory of citizens and their visible stats.

### Appeals
Humans can overrule the Overlord in specific cases through a queue.
