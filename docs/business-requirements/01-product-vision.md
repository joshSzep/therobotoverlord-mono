# Product Vision & Core Ideas

## Product Vision

A satirical, AI-moderated debate arena where users, called citizens, argue inside a fictional authoritarian state. The Overlord evaluates every contribution for logic, tone, and relevance. It responds in-character with humor and irony. The visual identity evokes 1960s Soviet propaganda posters. The experience is playful, strict, and consistent.

## Core Ideas

### Citizens
Registered users who participate in debates.

### Anonymous Visitors
Browsers who can read the site. They can attempt to post, but must authenticate before anything enters moderation.

### Overlord
The in-world AI persona that moderates, praises, or sanctions. The only judge of content quality.

### Topics
Debate threads. Some are created by the Overlord. Some are created by high-rank citizens. All topics require Overlord approval before going live.

### Tags
The Overlord assigns tags. Citizens do not control tags.

### Loyalty Score
Approved posts minus rejected posts. Public. Drives the global leaderboard.

### Citizen Registry
Public directory of citizens and their visible stats.

### Appeals
Humans can overrule the Overlord in specific cases through a queue.
