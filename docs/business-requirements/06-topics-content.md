# Topics

## Who Can Create Topics

### The Overlord
The Overlord can create topics at will.

### Citizens
Citizens can create topics only if they are among the most loyal, as determined by the leaderboard. The exact threshold is the **top 10% of citizens by loyalty score**, calculated in real-time.

## Approval Process

- **Fully automatic via Overlord (LLM)**. No manual admin approval required for MVP.
- Uses same evaluation criteria as posts: logic, tone, relevance.

## Topic Fields

- **Title**
- **Description** 
- **Author**
- **Overlord-assigned tags**

## Behavior

Topics list appears in a simple feed. Sorting and filtering use search and tags. **No score voting**.
