# Navigation and Information Architecture

## Global Feeds

### Topics Feed
List of debate topics. No special pinning. Overlord announcements appear as ordinary topics authored by the Overlord.

### Evaluation Queues
A real-time visualization of content waiting for judgment across multiple specialized queues. Styled as a dynamic pneumatic tube system that expands and contracts based on activity. Each queue type has its own visual branch from a central hub. This is visible to everyone and encourages discovery.

## Search

### Keyword Search
Keyword search across topics and posts.

### Browse by Tags
Browse by Overlord-assigned tags.

## Overlord Chat

Conversational entry point to ask about rules, find debates, and discover people with similar or opposing stances. The Overlord can answer questions like:
- "Show debates about global warming."
- "Which citizens often oppose ICE raids."

Responses are derived from public debates and Overlord-assigned tags.
