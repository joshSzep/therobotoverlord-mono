# Queue Status System

## Concept

Clear, honest communication about queue position and estimated wait times through status cards and Overlord commentary. Replaces complex visualization with transparent, scalable status updates.

## Queue Status Cards

### Topic Approval Bureau
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🏛️ TOPIC APPROVAL BUREAU        │
│ Your submission: Position #3     │

│ Current status: Under review     │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Debate Moderation Office

```

### Private Communication Review
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔒 PRIVATE MESSAGE REVIEW       │
│ Your message: Position #2       │
│ Estimated review: 1-3 minutes   │
│ Current status: Under review     │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Overlord Commentary System

### Progressive Status Updates
- **Initial**: "Citizen, your submission has been logged. Position #3 in the queue."
- **Processing**: "The Committee is now reviewing your proposal. Maintain patience."
- **Near completion**: "Your reasoning shows promise. Final evaluation in progress..."

### Context-Aware Messages
Commentary varies based on queue position, wait time, and submission type while maintaining authoritarian character.

## Public Queue Overview
