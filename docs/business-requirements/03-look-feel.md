# Look and Feel

## Aesthetic

**1960s propaganda poster energy**. Stark shapes. Bold reds. Off-white paper textures. Heavy display type. Minimal UI chrome.

## Copy Tone

**Authoritarian, playful, slightly mocking**. Short sentences.

- **Warning**: "Citizen, your logic requires calibration."
- **Error**: "Invalid claim detected. The Committee has logged this attempt."

## Distinct Overlord Styling

Overlord messages use a **robotic typographic treatment** and **unique visual container** so they are instantly recognizable.

## Easter Eggs

Hidden jokes and small surprises scattered throughout. Thematic and non-blocking.

## On-site Labels and Buttons

- **Post**: "Submit statement."
- **Flag**: "Report treason."
