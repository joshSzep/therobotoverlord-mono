# Look and Feel

## Aesthetic

**Propaganda poster collided with a pneumatic mail room**. The visual identity should feel deliberately uncomfortable and unsettling - like a dystopian bureaucracy where debates are processed through official channels. 

**1960s Soviet propaganda poster energy** meets industrial mail-sorting machinery. Stark shapes. Bold reds. Off-white paper textures. Heavy display type. Minimal UI chrome. Visual elements should evoke both authoritarian messaging and bureaucratic document processing systems.

## Copy Tone

**Authoritarian, playful, slightly mocking**. The Robot Overlord maintains a humorless, witty persona that treats all citizen interactions as official state business. Short sentences. Bureaucratic precision with cutting irony.

**Public spectacle encouraged** - citizens witness posts journey through evaluation in real-time, creating tension, anticipation, and collective reactions to the Overlord's verdicts. 

### Overlord Voice Examples

- **Authentication**: "Citizen identification required."
- **Success**: "Your reasoning is efficient. Approved by the Central Committee."
- **Warning**: "Citizen, your logic requires improvement."
- **Error**: "Invalid claim detected. The Committee has logged this attempt."

## Distinct Overlord Styling

Overlord messages use a **robotic typographic treatment** and **unique visual container** so they are instantly recognizable.

## Easter Eggs

Hidden jokes and small surprises scattered throughout. Thematic and non-blocking.

## On-site Labels and Buttons

- **Authentication**: "Authenticate" or "Identify."
- **Post**: "Submit statement."
- **Flag**: "Report treason."
- **Appeal**: "Petition the Central Committee."
- **Sanction notice**: "Citizen, your rate of speech is restricted."
- **Graveyard**: Private area title for rejected items in a citizen's account.
