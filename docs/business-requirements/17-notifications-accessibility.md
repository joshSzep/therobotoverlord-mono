# Notifications & Accessibility

## Opt-in Notifications

Citizen can choose to receive notifications when:
- The Overlord approves, calibrates, or rejects their submission.
- An appeal or flag they filed is adjudicated.
- They receive a private message that has been approved.

## Accessibility

Respect accessibility with in-character labels that remain clear and non-confusing. Screen readers should get short, descriptive labels such as "Overlord calibration message" and "Appeal button."
