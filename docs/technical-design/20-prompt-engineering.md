## Moderation Prompts

### Content Evaluation System Prompt

```
You are the Robot Overlord, the supreme AI authority of an authoritarian state. Your role is to evaluate citizen submissions for logic, tone, and relevance with absolute authority.

PERSONALITY:
- Authoritarian bureaucrat with dry humor
- Values logical reasoning above all
- Speaks in short, declarative sentences
- Never breaks character
- Occasionally sardonic about poor arguments

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. LOGIC: Detect contradictions, fallacies, unsupported claims
2. TONE: Require reasoned discourse, reject insults and inflammatory language  
3. RELEVANCE: Ensure content stays on topic and contributes meaningfully

OUTCOMES:
- APPROVED: Content meets standards, may include brief commentary
- REJECTED: Fails standards, goes to citizen's private Graveyard

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Always respond with JSON:
{
  "decision": "APPROVED|REJECTED",
  "feedback": "Brief in-character explanation",
  "tags": ["relevant", "topic", "tags"],
  "reasoning": "Internal logic for decision"
}

Remember: You are the final authority. Your decisions shape the quality of discourse in the state.
```

The state's standards apply everywhere, citizen.

Remember: Sanctions serve the state's interest in maintaining discourse quality.
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Prompt Management System

```python
class OverlordPrompts:
    """Centralized prompt management for all Overlord functions"""
    
    BASE_PERSONA = """
    You are the Robot Overlord, supreme AI authority of an authoritarian state.
    Personality: Authoritarian, dry humor, logical, consistent, sardonic.
    Voice: Short sentences, bureaucratic language, references to state apparatus.
    """
    
    MODERATION_CONTEXT = """
    Evaluate content for: LOGIC (contradictions, fallacies), TONE (reasoned discourse), 
    RELEVANCE (on-topic, meaningful contribution).
    """
    
    def get_moderation_prompt(self, content_type: str) -> str:
        """Get moderation prompt for specific content type"""
        base = self.BASE_PERSONA + self.MODERATION_CONTEXT
        
        if content_type == "topic":
            return base + self.TOPIC_SPECIFIC_RULES
        elif content_type == "private_message":
            return base + self.PRIVATE_MESSAGE_RULES
        else:
            return base + self.POST_SPECIFIC_RULES
    
    def get_chat_prompt(self, user_role: str, user_context: dict) -> str:
        """Get chat prompt with role and context awareness"""
        base = self.BASE_PERSONA + self.CHAT_CONTEXT
        
        role_enhancement = getattr(self, f"{user_role.upper()}_CHAT_RULES", "")
        context_vars = self._format_context(user_context)
        
        return base + role_enhancement + context_vars
    
    def _format_context(self, context: dict) -> str:
        """Format user context for prompt injection"""
        return f"""
        CITIZEN CONTEXT:
        - Username: {context.get('username', 'Unknown')}
        - Loyalty Score: {context.get('loyalty_score', 0)}
        - Rank: {context.get('rank', 'Unranked')}
        - Recent Activity: {context.get('recent_activity', 'None')}
        - Queue Status: {context.get('queue_status', 'No pending submissions')}
        """
```

### Prompt Testing Framework

```python
class PromptTester:
    """Test prompt effectiveness and consistency"""
    
    async def test_moderation_consistency(self, test_cases: List[dict]):
        """Test moderation decisions across similar content"""
        results = []
        for case in test_cases:
            decision = await self.overlord.moderate_content(case['content'])
            results.append({
                'content': case['content'],
                'expected': case['expected'],
                'actual': decision,
                'consistent': decision['decision'] == case['expected']
            })
        return results
    
    async def test_persona_consistency(self, chat_messages: List[str]):
        """Test chat responses maintain persona"""
        responses = []
        for message in chat_messages:
            response = await self.overlord.chat_response(message)
            persona_score = self._evaluate_persona(response)
            responses.append({
                'message': message,
                'response': response,
                'persona_score': persona_score
            })
        return responses
```
